# Product Description Wireframe (SEO-First)

This repository contains a **modular, SEO-first product description wireframe** designed for ecommerce Product Detail Pages (PDPs).

It focuses on **content structure**, not copywriting — showing how high-performing product pages can be architected to support:

- Search intent coverage
- Scannability and UX
- CMS flexibility
- Collaboration between SEO, content, and engineering teams

---

## What This Is

A **content architecture template** for product pages.

Each section represents a reusable block commonly used on ecommerce PDPs, broken down by:
- Purpose (SEO / UX / CRO)
- Content guidelines
- Structural intent (above-the-fold vs supporting content)

The wireframe is CMS-agnostic and can be adapted for:
- Shopify
- Magento
- Headless setups
- Custom in-house CMSs

---

## What This Is Not

- ❌ A finished product description
- ❌ Brand-specific copy
- ❌ Design or UI mockups

This is intentionally **content-first** and **platform-neutral**.
