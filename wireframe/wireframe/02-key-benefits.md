It is designed for:

## SEO Intent

- Support semantic keyword variation
- Capture secondary modifiers and use-case language
- Improve relevance without repeating the primary keyword excessively

---

## Content Guidelines

**Recommended format:**  
- 3–5 short benefit blocks  
- Each block: 1 headline + 1 supporting sentence

**Each benefit should:**
- Focus on an outcome (not a feature)
- Be understandable out of context
- Use natural language aligned with user queries

**Avoid:**
- Long paragraphs
- Technical specifications
- Marketing superlatives without context

---

## Structural Notes

- Typically displayed as:
  - Bullet points
  - Icons with text
  - Horizontally scrollable cards on mobile

- Headlines should remain meaningful even if:
  - Icons fail to load
  - Styling is stripped
