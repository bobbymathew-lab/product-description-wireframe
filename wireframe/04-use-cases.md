## Purpose

The use cases section demonstrates how the product fits into real-world scenarios.

It helps users:

## SEO Intent

- Capture long-tail and situational queries

- Reduce mismatch between search intent and product fit

---

## Content Guidelines

**Recommended format:**
- 3–6 short use cases
- Each use case includes:
  - A descriptive headline
  - 1–2 sentences of context

**Best practices:**
- Focus on situations, not personas
- Use natural language mirroring user queries
- Keep each use case independent and skimmable

**Avoid:**

## Structural Notes
