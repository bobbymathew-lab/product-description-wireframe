# 01. Hero Summary (Above the Fold)

## Purpose

The hero summary is the most visible and influential content block on a Product Detail Page.

Its role is to:
- Immediately confirm search relevance
- Communicate the core value proposition
- Support primary keyword targeting without keyword stuffing

This section should work even if the user does not scroll.

---

## SEO Intent

- Satisfy primary commercial intent
- Reinforce relevance for the main product keyword
- Align with title tag and H1 without duplicating them verbatim

---

## Content Guidelines

**Recommended length:** 40–60 words

**Include:**
- Product type (clear and unambiguous)
- Primary differentiator (material, function, category, or use case)
- One natural mention of the primary keyword or close variant

**Avoid:**
- Marketing fluff
- Feature lists
- Technical specifications
- Repetitive keyword usage

---

## Structural Notes

- Typically paired with:
  - Product title (H1)
  - Price
  - Ratings / reviews
  - Primary CTA

- Should remain readable when:
  - Truncated on mobile
  - Rendered without custom CSS

---

## Example (Placeholder)

> *A lightweight, noise-cancelling wireless headphone designed for long listening sessions. Features balanced sound, all-day battery life, and a comfortable over-ear fit suitable for work, travel, and everyday use.*

---

## Internal Linking Notes (Optional)

If applicable, this section may:
- Reference a key category or collection page
- Use natural anchor text within body copy (not forced links)

---

## Why This Section Matters

Poorly structured hero summaries often cause:
- High bounce rates
- Thin or duplicated PDP content
- Over-reliance on design to convey value

A strong hero summary anchors both **UX clarity** and **SEO relevance**.
