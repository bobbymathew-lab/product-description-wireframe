# 05. Specifications (Structured Reference)

## Purpose

The specifications section provides factual, scannable information for users who want precise product details.

It supports:
- Comparison-driven decision making
- Technical validation
- Reduced support and pre-purchase queries

---

## SEO Intent

- Capture specification-based and comparison queries
- Support rich results and structured data
- Prevent overloading narrative sections with technical detail

---

## Content Guidelines

**Recommended format:**
- Table or definition list
- Label–value pairs
- Consistent ordering across similar products

**Best practices:**
- Use standardized units and terminology
- Keep values concise and unambiguous
- Group related specs together where possible

**Avoid:**
- Embedding specs inside paragraphs
- Mixing benefits or marketing language with factual data
- Duplicating spec content across multiple PDPs without normalization

---

## Structural Notes

- Should be:
  - Easily collapsible on mobile
  - Accessible via jump links
- Labels should remain meaningful without surrounding context
