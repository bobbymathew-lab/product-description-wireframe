# 03. Feature Breakdown (Structured Depth)

## Purpose

The feature breakdown section provides detailed information for users who want to evaluate the product more closely.

It supports:
- Informed purchasing decisions
- Comparison-driven intent
- Long-tail SEO coverage

This section is typically consumed after the key benefits.

---

## SEO Intent

- Capture feature-specific and technical modifiers
- Support comparison and research queries
- Reduce the need for excessive content elsewhere on the page

---

## Content Guidelines

**Recommended format:**
- Feature name (short, descriptive)
- 1–2 sentence explanation per feature

**Best practices:**
- Keep feature names consistent across PDPs
- Explain *what the feature does*, not just that it exists
- Use plain language where possible

**Avoid:**
- Marketing slogans
- Repeating benefit headlines verbatim
- Overloading with specs better suited for a specification table

---

## Structural Notes

- May be displayed as:
  - Accordion sections
  - Vertical lists
  - Two-column layouts on desktop

- Feature titles should remain meaningful when:
  - Used as accordion headers
  - Indexed independently by search engines

## SEO & Content Notes

- Feature sections can:
  - Be reused across similar products
  - Feed comparison tables or category filters
- Avoid duplicating feature text across multiple PDPs without variation

## Why This Section Matters

Overloaded or poorly explained feature sections often:
- Confuse users
- Dilute SEO relevance
- Inflate word count without adding value

A structured feature breakdown balances **depth, clarity, and crawlability**.
